# Persistence landscapes for affine fractals

This repository contains python scripts for computing and visualizing
the persistence landscapes for three different affine fractals: the
middle-thirds Cantor set, a modified one-fifth Cantor set, and the
Cantor triangle. Each of these examples is explained in detail in the preprint [TBD]().
The outputs of these scripts are included in the Images folder.

To modify the examples for a different affine fractal, define the underlying IFS
of the fractal and iteratively apply each to the domain, as is done at the beginning
of each of the three scripts.
